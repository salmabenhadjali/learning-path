# Salma's Coding Adventure 🚀🌍

Welcome to **Salma's Learning Odyssey**! 🌌 This repository is where I document, share, and sometimes laugh (or cry) at my coding adventures as I dive deeper into the vast realms of programming and tech. Buckle up, because we're in for a ride! 🎢

## 📜 What's This About?

Imagine this repository as my personal **digital journal**, where every commit is a new chapter, every file is a step closer to coding mastery, and **each branch is a new topic or theme**. It's like a Netflix series, but instead of cliffhangers, you get functions, bugs, and aha-moments. 🍿🤓

From conquering TypeScript dragons 🐉, befriending the elusive React hooks 🎣, to scaling the Symfony mountains ⛰️, this repo is a log of my coding journey, progress, and the occasional ramble when something just won't work!

## 🧭 What You'll Find Here

* **Projects**: Mini-apps, experiments, and snippets that mark my progress.
* **Challenges**: Code challenges, problem-solving exercises, and other brain teasers 🧩.
* **Notes & Resources**: Handy guides, cheatsheets, and any helpful nuggets I pick up along the way. They’re like breadcrumbs on this adventure trail.
* **Experiments**: This is where things get weird. Expect trial and error, weird code structures, and moments of "Did that really work?"

## 🌿 Branches as Adventures

Each branch in this repository represents a unique topic, framework, or concept that I'm diving into. Consider it as a new quest in this coding journey, with every branch focusing on a specific area – whether it's React, Symfony, TypeScript, or something else entirely! 💡🚩

To switch topics, just checkout a different branch and explore along with me.

## 🎢 The Adventure So Far

* Chapter 1: "The Beginnings" – Getting familiar with the tools and languages. Hello world? More like hello universe! 🌌
* Chapter 2: "Bugs & Debugs" – Learning from each bug, and savoring every successful compile.
* Chapter 3: "Framework Frenzy" – Exploring new frameworks and understanding how each one builds on the last.
* Chapter 4 and beyond... Stay tuned. 🚀

## 🤓 Follow Along

If you're into learning, laughing, and maybe a bit of coding chaos, then follow along! Star the repo ⭐, fork it, or just check in from time to time to see where my journey has taken me.

Thanks for stopping by – let's make coding fun, one bug at a time!

## 🚀 About this project 🚀

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
